Thank you for stumbleling on to my website. I am currently a Data Scientist at Lab41 working secure machine learning with an interest in computer vision, signal processing and natural language processing. I recently finished my PhD researching solar forecasting with images of the sky ie. I am an expert at identifying the sky blue color. 

In my spare time I do too many hobbies to keep my sell entertained. I enjoy biking, soccer, surfing, drawing and taking just about anything apart.
